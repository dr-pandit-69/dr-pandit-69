 Welcome to the profile of dr-pandit-69🤪
Mhmm, as weird as that name username sounds, I'm B H V S P Subrahmanyam or Balabhadrapatruni Hari Vaishnavi Sai Pavaan Subrahmanyam (Sharma, omitted due to exceeding name length in documents)
I know it's getting wEiRdEr already.

# History🔎🧭

I'm originally from Hyderabad, I wanted to be a YouTuber as a kid, I opened a YT channel at the age of 11 called STPHD (Striker Tech Productions HD, pshhh I know it's wannabe MKBHD) it did it get 500k+ views which was mASSive for a little kid, however (un)fortunately I got my 🍑 whipped by momma dadda to focus on good grades (avg desi kid life), I also loved hacking as a kid, in the days of 249 1GB 3G data packs, I'd distribute wifi pwds to kids in my colony like birthday chocolates, that's when I got my second 🍑 whip, I also loved hard-bricking Android phones to the point that Service centre guys hurl abuses fixing it, but as you'd already expect, that's when I got my 3rd 🍑 whip, that's enough 🍑 whip stories.
